Decompilation and source-reconstruction project for **Pokémon Shining Pearl**.

This repository is part of the **Generation VIII decompilation cohort** together with Sword, Shield, Brilliant Diamond, and Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Each game remains an independent reconstruction target.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reconstruct game code and data into readable, editable source form.
- Document executable structures, data formats, scripts, assets, and version differences.
- Preserve Shining Pearl-specific behavior and version-exclusive data.
- Compare with Brilliant Diamond and original Generation IV titles without assuming implementation identity.
- Keep analysis, tooling, metadata, and documentation reproducible.

## 🚧 Status

Active work has begun with **Phase 0: target intake and reproducibility**. Exact local targets are identified before executable/data mapping and source reconstruction.

See [Decompilation Start](docs/DECOMPILATION_START.md) and [Project Status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md).

## 📌 Repository policy

Retail game images, decrypted package archives, console keys, and complete redistributed game binaries are not committed. Reconstructed source, project data, tooling, analysis, manifests, documentation, patches, and reviewable non-ROM work products may be tracked.

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [x] Establish clean repository baseline
- [x] Begin target intake workflow
- [ ] Verify exact Shining Pearl revisions/updates
- [ ] Map executable and data structures
- [ ] Begin bounded source reconstruction
- [ ] Document scripts, data formats, assets, and version differences
- [ ] Add reproducible verification and matching workflows

## 🔬 Research and verification

BD/SP similarities are useful research leads, but deduplication and shared-source conclusions require direct evidence. Original Diamond/Pearl/Platinum behavior may guide comparison but does not establish BDSP implementation details.
