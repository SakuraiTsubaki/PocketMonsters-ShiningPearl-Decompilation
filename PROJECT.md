# Target Profile: Pocket Monsters Shining Pearl

## Known repository scope

- Repository: `SakuraiTsubaki/PocketMonsters-ShiningPearl-Decompilation`
- Working target name: Pocket Monsters Shining Pearl
- Platform family: Nintendo Switch
- Series generation: Generation VIII
- Exact release, region, revision, and build: **not yet selected**

The repository name is a working label, not proof of a particular binary. No address, symbol, format, or behavior should be treated as target fact until the exact build is identified.

## Identity checklist

Record all available items before substantive reconstruction:

- official title and product identifier;
- platform and execution environment;
- region, language, revision, update, and distribution form;
- hashes for user-supplied images, executables, modules, or manifests;
- executable/container layout and relevant segment identifiers;
- analysis, extraction, compiler, linker, and SDK tool versions;
- legal provenance and distribution constraints for every input;
- differences from related versions that affect addresses, formats, or behavior.

Store machine-readable identifiers in `config/target.json`. Keep the ROM binary outside Git and commit every storable non-ROM result.

## Initial research priorities

- Fingerprint the exact title/update, executable build IDs, Unity version, and IL2CPP metadata/code pairing.
- Map native modules, generated metadata, type/method identifiers, runtime interfaces, and version-specific addresses.
- Document Unity assets, bundles, serialization, compression, text, audio, maps, and scripts from lawful user inputs.
- Keep the ROM binary outside Git; commit all storable non-ROM extracted, converted, documented, and verified results.
- Build deterministic metadata, symbol, asset, and cross-version comparison tools with verified input hashes.

## First milestone

The foundation milestone is complete when the exact target build is recorded, the initial file/executable map is reproducible, at least one research record has been promoted to an analysis with stated confidence, and all commands needed to repeat that result are documented.

## Non-ROM artifact preservation

Follow [ARTIFACT_POLICY.md](ARTIFACT_POLICY.md). Preserve all storable non-ROM research, source, scripts, tools, logs, manifests, tables, structured data, graphics, sprites, palettes, fonts, icons, tiles, converted data, patches, and verification material. Graphics work must include actual PNG output.
