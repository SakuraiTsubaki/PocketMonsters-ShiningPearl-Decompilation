# Documentation Hub

This directory is the central documentation portal for the decompilation project. The current phase is a **ROM-less exhaustive public-source census**, using the Japanese release as the comparison baseline while preserving Shining Pearl-specific and all-region differences.

## Recommended research flow

1. Check `research/SOURCE_COVERAGE_TRACKER.md` before declaring any family complete.
2. Identify the exact 1.0.0/updated target state in `VERSIONS.md`.
3. Register primary and technical sources in `research/PUBLIC_SOURCE_INDEX.md`.
4. Keep Shining Pearl branches/data separate from Brilliant Diamond.
5. Keep Unity/IL2CPP evidence separate from assumptions imported from other Pokémon engines.
6. Apply `RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`, `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` and `VERIFICATION.md` when reconstructing classes/data/scripts/assets.
7. Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` when meaningful milestones change.

## Documentation rules

- Representative samples do not satisfy exhaustive survey requirements.
- Japanese material is the comparison baseline; regional differences are preserved independently.
- 1.0.0 and every update remain historical targets instead of being overwritten by final-patch behavior.
- Gen IV DP/Platinum data is comparison evidence, not replacement BDSP data.
- Use `TBD`, `unknown` or `null` rather than inventing internal information.
- Preserve provenance and distinguish public-source observation from direct target verification.
- Keep retail game images, decrypted game images and console keys out of the repository.
